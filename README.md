# My Development Configuration

This little Git repository documents my development configuration.

Bits and pieces have been obtained from various locations on the
internet, unfortunately not always referencing the original author.

If you recognize your own brain work in some of the configuration files
found in this repository, feel free to contact me, so that credits may be
added to the code portion(s) in question.

If not otherwise stated in individual files, all code and config
fragments can be freely re-used, without any sort of limitation or
regulation.
